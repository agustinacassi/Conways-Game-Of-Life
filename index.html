        The Game of Life is a cellular automaton consisting of a two-dimensional
        grid of cells that can be in one of two states: alive or dead. It
        evolves over time following simple rules, where live cells with too few
        or too many live neighbors die, and dead cells with exactly three live
        neighbors become alive, giving rise to complex and fascinating patterns.

        Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives. <br />
        Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell. <br />
        All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other
        dead cells stay dead.<br />
